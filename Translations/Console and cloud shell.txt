# LAB: Google cloud fundamentals: Getting started with cloud marketplace

## Objectives
In this lab, you learn how to perform the following tasks:

	. Get access to Google Cloud.

	. Create a Cloud Storage bucket using the Cloud Console.

	. Create a Cloud Storage bucket using Cloud Shell.

	. Become familiar with Cloud Shell features.
	
# Steps:

	1. Click Create bucket and For Name, type a globally unique bucket name, and leave all other values as their defaults
	
			gsutil mb gs://yerimah
			
	2. Use the gsutil command to create another bucket. Replace <BUCKET_NAME> with a globally unique name 
	(you can append a 2 to the globally unique bucket name you used previously)
	
			gsutil mb gs://yerimah-shell
			
		-click Refresh if you are already in the Storage Browser. The second bucket should be displayed in the Buckets list
	
			gcloud compute buckets list
	
	
		-Click the three dots icon in the Cloud Shell toolbar to display further options and Click Upload file. Upload any file from your local machine to the Cloud Shell VM. 
	This file will be referred to as [MY_FILE]
	
		-Copy the file into one of the buckets you created earlier in the lab. 
	Replace [MY_FILE] with the file you uploaded and [BUCKET_NAME] with one of your bucket names
	
			gsutil cp [MY_FILE] gs://yerimah-shell
			
		- Results: You have uploaded a file to the Cloud Shell VM and copied it to a bucket	
	
	
	3. To list available regions, execute the following command
	
			gcloud compute regions list
			
		- Select a region from the list and note the value in any text editor. 
		This region will now be referred to as [YOUR_REGION] in the remainder of the lab

	4. Create an environment variable and replace [YOUR_REGION] with the region you selected in the previous step
	
			INFRACLASS_REGION=us-central1
			
		- Verify it with echo
		
			echo $INFRACLASS_REGION
			
			You can use environment variables like this in gcloud commands to reduce the opportunities for typos, 
			and so that you won't have to remember a lot of detailed information
			
	5. Create a subdirectory for materials used in this class

			mkdir infraclass
			
		- Create a file called config in the infraclass directory
		
			touch infraclass/config
			
		- Append the value of your Region environment variable to the config file

			echo INFRACLASS_REGION=$INFRACLASS_REGION >> ~/infraclass/config
			
		- Create a second environment variable for your Project ID, 
		replacing [YOUR_PROJECT_ID] with your Project ID. You can find the project ID on the Cloud Console Home page
		
			INFRACLASS_PROJECT_ID=[YOUR_PROJECT_ID]
		
	
		- Append the value of your Project ID environment variable to the config file
		
			echo INFRACLASS_PROJECT_ID=$INFRACLASS_PROJECT_ID >> ~/infraclass/config
			
		- Use the source command to set the environment variables, 
		and use the echo command to verify that the project variable was set
		
			source infraclass/config echo $INFRACLASS_PROJECT_ID
		
		- Close and re-open Cloud Shell. Then issue the echo command again
		
			echo $INFRACLASS_PROJECT_ID
			
		- Result: There will be no output because the environment variable no longer exists
		
	6. Edit the shell profile with the following command:
	
			nano .profile
			
		- Add the following line to the end of the file
		
			source infraclass/config
			
		- Save the file and exit the nano editor
		
		Use the echo command to verify that the variable is still set
		
			echo $INFRACLASS_PROJECT_ID
			
		- Results: You should now see the expected value that you set in the config file
